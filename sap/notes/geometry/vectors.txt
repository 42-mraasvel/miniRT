Vector Definition:
	Array of numbers
	Also known as "tuple"
	n-tuple = array of n elements.

	V={a,b,c,d,e,f} = 6-tuple.


Point:
	position in a three-dimensional space. (x, y, z)

Vector:
	direction + magnitude/size.

Homogeneous Point:
	Point with a fourth coordinate (x, y, z, w).
	Used for multiplying matrices

Linear Transformation:
	The process of transforming the content of a vector.
	For changing the position or rotation of the vector.

Normalised vector:
	When the length of a vector is equal to 1.
	Normalising a vector means to change it so it's length is 1, but direction is unchanged.

Normals:
	Surface normal at point P, is the vector perpendicular to the plane.
	Used in shading.
