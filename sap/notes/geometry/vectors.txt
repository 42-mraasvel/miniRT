Vector Definition:
	Array of numbers
	Also known as "tuple"
	n-tuple = array of n elements.

	V={a,b,c,d,e,f} = 6-tuple.

Definitions:

	Point:
		position in a three-dimensional space. (x, y, z)
		Representation of position.

	Vector:
		direction + magnitude/size.
		Direction in a 3D space.
		Length of a vector represents the distance between two points.

	Homogeneous Point:
		Point with a fourth coordinate (x, y, z, w).
		Used for multiplying matrices

	Linear Transformation:
		The process of transforming the content of a vector.
		For changing the position or rotation of the vector.
		Translation for points, rotation for vectors.

	Normalised vector:
		When the length of a vector is equal to 1.
		Normalising a vector means to change it so it's length is 1, but direction is unchanged.

	Normals:
		Surface normal at point P, is the vector perpendicular to the plane.
		Used in shading.
