Vector and Point Operations:

Length of a vector formula:
	||V|| = (root)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2);
	||V|| = length, also called norm or magnitude.

Normalized vector (unit vector):
	length = 1 unit.
	V^ = V / ||V||
	(Euclidean Norm Function)

Dot Product: (return number)
	Vector A * Vector B
	< A, B >
	a.x * b.x + a.y * b.y + a.z + b.z
	If both are unit vectors, then < A, B > = cos(angle subtended by the two vectors)

	angle theta = cos-1(A^ * B^);
	(A^ * B^) = A * B / ||A|| * ||B||

	Returns:
		If 2 vectors are perpendicular: 0
		Opposite direction: -1
		Same direction: 1
	Used to compute the angle between 2 vectors.

Cross Product: (return vector)
	C = A x B
	Cx = Ay * Bz - Az * By
	Cy = Az * Bx - Ax * Bz
	Cz = Ax * By - Ay * Bx
	Resulting vector orthogonal to the other 2.
