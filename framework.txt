Algorithm For MiniRT

1. Check program arguments (rt file and --save option)
2. Read in the scene from the rt file.
	- Capital definitions can only be declared once in the scene
3. Render the scene
4. Display scene on MLX window or save to bmp file
5. Exit program cleanly


Rendering the scene:

	For each Pixel p in the window:
	{
		1. Associate a black color to p
		2. 'trace' the ray from the camera to p, if it intersects any object then
		{
			1. calculate the intersection point to the nearest object
			2. If there is no object between the intersection point and the light source:
			{
				1. calculate the color of the intersection point.
				2. associate the color of the intersection point to p
			}
		}
	}
